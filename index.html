            <p>I love to vacation, but then again, who doesn't?</p>
            <p>Here are a few of the vacations I have taken, and one I will take soon!</p>

            <div class="title" id="firstvaca">My First Vacation</div>
            <p>I had my very first vacation around my 16th birthday. It was my first time taking an airplane and my first time
                out of the midwestand I was headed to the infamous city of Los Angeles.</p>
            <p>My family and I traveled to LA on a couple of other occasions, falling on my 17th and 18th birthdays. It was a popular place for my family
                to travel to during those times.</p>

            <div class="title" id="windycity">The Windy City</div>
            <p>After high school, I took a couple of weekend trips via bus to Chicago.</p>

        <article>
            <div class="title" id="yellowstone">Yellowstone</div>
            <p>One of my favorite places I've traveled to in the U.S. is Yellowstone. It is quite a beautiful site. I really
                enjoyed spending all of my time outdoors camping, hiking, and viewing all the natural phenominons that exist
                there.</p>

        <article>
            <div class="title" id="solotrip">First Solo Trip</div>
            <p>Being busy with work and school, I did not travel much until some time after I graduated college. This time,
                I was headed out of the country to Thailand. My brother lives in the city of Chaing Mai, Thailand
                and I went to visit him and his family as well as get my first glipse of the world outside of the U.S.</p>

        <article>
            <div class="title" id="nextadventure">On to the Next Adventure</div>
            <p>The next year I found myself having the opportunity to travel to Chongqing, China around Chinese New Year. Chongqing (pronounced Ch&oacute;ngq&igrave;ng)
                is a rather large city in southwest China that, surprisingly, not many people (even myself prior) have heard
                of.</p>

        <article>
            <div class="title" id="backagain">Back Again</div>
            <p>I went back to Chongqing again the next year.</p>

        <article>
            <div class="title" id="regularthing">Making it a Regular Thing</div>
            <p>This month I am headed yet again to China to visit those I have come to know and see more of the country I have
                not yet had a chance to explore. I will spend some time in Beijing, Chongqing, and Chengdu.</p>
