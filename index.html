				<p>My First Vacation</p>
				<p>I had my very first vacation around my 16th birthday. It was my first time taking an airplane and my first time out of the midwest..and I was headed to the infamous city of Los Angeles.</p>

				<p>Next Few Vactions</p>
				<p>The next several trips were back to LA on my 17th and again on my 18th birthdays. It was a popular place for my family to travel to during those times. I also took a couple of short trips to Chicago.</p>
